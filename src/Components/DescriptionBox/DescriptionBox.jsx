                <p>E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, 
                    refers to the buying and selling of goods and services over 
                    the internet. It has revolutionized the way businesses 
                    operate and how consumers shop. In an e-commerce environment,
                     transactions are conducted electronically, allowing customers 
                     to browse, select, and purchase products or services from the
                      comfort of their homes or wherever they have internet access.
